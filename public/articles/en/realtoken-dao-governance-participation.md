# How to participate in RealToken DAO governance?

The RealToken DAO belongs to those who participate in it. But how do you go from being a mere observer to an active governance member? This practical guide walks you through the concrete steps to contribute to the decisions that shape the ecosystem.

## Step 1: Get REG tokens

REG (RealToken Ecosystem Governance) is the DAO’s governance token. Holding REG means holding voting power on the direction of the ecosystem.

- **Via YAM**: The YAM (Your Asset Manager) platform lets you buy and trade REG directly with other community members.
- **Via contribution**: Active contributions to the ecosystem — development, communication, community building — can be rewarded in REG by DAO decision.

The more REG you hold, the greater your weight in collective decisions.

## Step 2: Join the community forum

Before voting or proposing, the essential step is to **join the forum** (forum.realtoken.community). This is where the day-to-day life of the DAO happens:

- **Discussions**: Every major decision goes through an open debate phase first.
- **Informal proposals**: Before being put to an on-chain vote, an idea is shared on the forum to be refined and gather support.
- **Tracking decisions**: Vote outcomes and their implementation are documented and discussed there in a transparent way.

Taking part in discussions is one of the most accessible forms of contribution, even without holding REG.

## Step 3: Vote on Tally

Official DAO votes take place **on-chain via Tally** (tally.xyz/gov/realtoken-ecosystem-governance). This is where decisions are recorded in a transparent and immutable way on the blockchain.

- **View active proposals**: Tally lists all current proposals with their full description and arguments for and against.
- **Delegate your vote**: If you prefer not to follow every proposal yourself, you can delegate your voting power to a trusted community member.
- **Vote directly**: Connect your wallet to Tally and cast your vote. Every vote, even with a small amount of REG, contributes to the democratic legitimacy of decisions.

## Step 4: Submit a proposal

Have an idea to improve the ecosystem? The DAO is open to initiatives from all its members. Here is the typical process:

1. **Preliminary discussion on the forum**: Present your idea, gather community feedback, and refine your proposal before moving forward.
2. **Draft a formal proposal**: Once the idea is mature, write a structured proposal: context, objective, budget if needed, success metrics.
3. **On-chain submission via Tally**: The proposal can then be submitted for an on-chain vote. A minimum amount of REG is required to submit directly.
4. **Vote and execution**: If the proposal is adopted by the community, it enters the DAO’s execution cycle.

## Committees: getting involved over the long term

The DAO is also organized into **thematic committees** (Security, Marketing, Liquidity, Proposer, Voting Power, etc.) that work in depth on specific topics. Joining a committee means getting involved on a regular basis and building expertise recognized by the community.

Visit the [Committees](/committee) page to discover active groups and how to participate.

## In summary

Participating in RealToken DAO governance comes down to four steps: get REG, join the forum, vote on Tally, and put forward your own initiatives. Every action, however small, strengthens the legitimacy and vitality of the DAO.

Decentralized governance only works when the community gets involved. Your participation is what gives the RealToken DAO its value and legitimacy.
