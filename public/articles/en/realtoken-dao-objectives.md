# What is our objective?

The RealToken DAO does not simply manage an ecosystem — it pursues a clear vision: to make real-world assets accessible, liquid, and governed by the community. This article outlines the objectives that guide our decisions and actions every day.

## A vision: democratizing real-world assets

Our primary objective is to **democratize access to real-world assets** (RWA). In practice, this means:

- **Accessibility**: enabling more people to participate in the tokenization of real estate and other tangible assets, without excessive barriers
- **Liquidity**: facilitating the purchase, sale, and exchange of tokens representing real assets, through tools such as RMM (RealToken Market Maker) and YAM (Your Asset Manager)
- **Transparency**: ensuring that rules, data, and decisions are understandable and verifiable by all

In short, we aim for an ecosystem where ownership of real-world assets can be shared, traded, and governed in a decentralized way.

## Strengthening community governance

A second major objective is to **strengthen community governance**. The DAO must not depend on a small number of actors: holders of voting rights should be able to:

- **Propose** changes (integrations, tools, standards)
- **Discuss** and vote on strategic and operational directions
- **Monitor** the execution of decisions and their impact on the ecosystem

Our objective is therefore for governance to be legitimate, effective, and open to the entire RealToken community.

## Developing and securing the ecosystem

Finally, we set ourselves the objective of **developing and securing the ecosystem**:

- **Integration of new assets and partners**: expanding the range of real-world asset tokens while maintaining quality and compliance standards
- **Tools and standards**: maintaining and improving RMM, YAM, and the technical protocols that underpin tokenization
- **Long-term sustainability**: making decisions that ensure the project’s durability over time, in the interest of participants and users

In the end, our objective is to make the RealToken DAO the cornerstone of a robust, open, and community-governed RWA ecosystem.

## In summary

Our objective can be summed up in three pillars: **democratize real-world assets**, **strengthen community governance**, and **develop a sustainable ecosystem**. Every proposal, every vote, and every action of the DAO aims to move in this direction.
