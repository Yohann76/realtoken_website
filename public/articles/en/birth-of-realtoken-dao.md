# The Birth of the RealToken DAO

The RealToken DAO did not emerge by chance: it is the result of a shared vision — to make real-world assets accessible, liquid, and governed in a decentralized way. This article looks back at the DAO’s genesis and the milestones that marked its creation.

## An Ecosystem Coming of Age

Before the DAO, the RealToken ecosystem already relied on essential building blocks: real estate tokenization, market tools, and an engaged community. The need for a clear, decentralized governance structure gradually became obvious — to align interests, make collective decisions, and evolve the project in a transparent manner.

## The DAO’s Foundations

The creation of the RealToken DAO was built on several pillars:

- **An active community**: token holders and contributors already involved in the RealToken ecosystem
- **Shared goals**: development of tools (RMM, YAM), integration of new assets, and strengthening of RWA standards
- **A governance framework**: proposal, voting, and execution processes owned by the community

The DAO thus became the entity that embodies and structures this governance, while remaining open to anyone who wants to help shape the future of tokenized real-world assets.

## A Decentralized Autonomous Organization

As a decentralized autonomous organization, the RealToken DAO operates without relying on a single central authority. Proposals are submitted, discussed, and adopted by holders of voting rights, according to rules defined and accepted by the community. The birth of the DAO therefore marks the moment when the RealToken ecosystem entered a phase where governance is truly in the hands of its participants.

## What Comes Next?

Since its creation, the DAO has continued to refine its scope, processes, and priorities. Understanding its origins helps to better grasp its current role and the stakes of future decisions. To go further, you can read the article on [the scope of the RealToken DAO](/blog/realtoken-dao-scope).
