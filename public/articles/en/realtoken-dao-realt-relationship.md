# What is our relationship with RealT?

The RealToken DAO and RealT are often mentioned together — and for good reason: they belong to the same real-world asset tokenization ecosystem. But what exactly is the relationship between the DAO and RealT? This article clarifies that relationship and what it means for governance and the development of the project.

## An ecosystem born with RealT

**RealT** is at the origin of the RealToken ecosystem: real estate tokenization, the creation of tools (RMM — RealToken Market Maker, YAM — Your Asset Manager), and the building of a community around tokenized real-world assets (RWA). The RealToken DAO, for its part, was created to give this community a **decentralized governance** framework: to propose, vote, and steer the evolution of the ecosystem without depending on a single entity.

In short: RealT created and develops the technical and operational building blocks; the DAO embodies community governance over this ecosystem.

## Collaboration and complementarity

Our relationship with RealT is based on **collaboration and complementarity**:

- **RealT**: operations, development of platforms, asset integration, maintenance of protocols and tools (RMM, YAM, etc.)
- **The RealToken DAO**: strategic direction, validation of integrations or partnerships, definition of standards and priorities, all through community proposals and votes

The DAO does not replace RealT; it gives the community the means to **decide collectively** on the direction and rules that apply to the ecosystem. RealT remains a key actor for technical and operational implementation, in line with the decisions made by the DAO.

## Independence and legitimacy of the DAO

An important point: the RealToken DAO is **independent** in its decisions. Holders of voting rights (token holders, governance participants) decide according to the protocol’s rules, without RealT or any other actor being able to impose a direction unilaterally. Our relationship with RealT is therefore one of **partnership and ecosystem**, not subordination: the DAO steers, RealT (and other operators) execute within the framework defined by governance.

This independence is what gives the DAO its **legitimacy**: it represents the collective will of the RealToken community.

## In summary

Our relationship with RealT can be summed up as follows: **same ecosystem, distinct roles**. RealT is at the origin of the project and ensures its operational and technical development; the RealToken DAO ensures its decentralized governance. Together, they aim for the same goal — to grow and secure the tokenized real-world asset ecosystem — while ensuring that major decisions are made by the community.
