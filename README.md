# Realtoken Website

This project is the foundation of the website to present the Realtoken DAO.

A technology like WordPress was complicated to maintain on the community server, so a static technology like VueJS is perfect for creating a reliable, consistent, and scalable website foundation.

# Technologies

- VueJS 3 (https://vuejs.org/)
- Vite (https://vite.dev/)

## Run website with make

```sh
make dev-build   # Build 
make dev-run     # Run on port 5173
make dev-kill    # Stop container
```
